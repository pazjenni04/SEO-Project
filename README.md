# SEO-Project
This project is requesting that the webpage be updated to meet the standard accessibility guidelines.  One of the features I included in this webpage was a hover feature.  This hover feature allows the user to hover the cursor over the different sections on the page to increase the font size for ease of reading.  

Another feature incorporated into the page is a focus link.  This allows individuals who do not have accessibility to a mouse to tab through the page with ease, highlighting major points of the page.  

Along with the above features, alt texts were included within the HTML code in order to assist those who use the audio function of their computer to translate the images and/or links on the page.
