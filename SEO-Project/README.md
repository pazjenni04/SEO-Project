SMU homework assignment 5/1 - 5/8
This assignment is requesting that we include alt attributes to ensure accessibility standards.  This will result in search engine optimization.
Taking a look at the code to see what is already included in HTML code.  Trying to see if there are any low-hanging fruits and simple tweaks before dissecting how to improve overall.
Added hover links in css file to increase font size when you hover the cursor over the <p> tag -- need to see how can wrap text to stay in container so that text stays on the page.
